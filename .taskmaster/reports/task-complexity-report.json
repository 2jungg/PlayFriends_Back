			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Preferences Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a preference model, implementing CRUD endpoints, and handling validation. The code examples show moderate complexity with enum types, field validation, and MongoDB operations. The task is well-defined with clear requirements but requires careful implementation of the data model and validation logic.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement User Preferences Management' task into 5 subtasks, focusing on model definition, endpoint implementation, data storage, validation, and testing. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details and acceptance criteria."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Automatic Preference Learning",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex algorithmic work with weighted preference calculations based on time-series data. The implementation requires creating a feedback tracking system, developing a sophisticated algorithm for preference adjustment with temporal weighting, and implementing periodic recalculation. The code example shows complex data processing with weighted averages and timestamp-based calculations.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Automatic Preference Learning' task into 6 subtasks, focusing on activity history model implementation, feedback recording endpoints, preference adjustment algorithm, temporal weighting system, periodic recalculation mechanism, and comprehensive testing. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details and acceptance criteria."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Schedule Recommendation Algorithm",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"reasoning": "This task involves a highly complex algorithm that must aggregate group preferences, implement time-based scheduling with meal time prioritization, handle preference conflicts, and ensure variety in recommendations. The code example shows sophisticated logic for preference aggregation, weighted sorting, time-slot allocation, and activity duration management. This is one of the most algorithmically complex tasks in the project.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Schedule Recommendation Algorithm' task into 7 subtasks, focusing on preference aggregation from group members, time-based scheduling logic, schedule generation endpoint, variety constraints implementation, conflict resolution mechanism, meal time prioritization, and comprehensive testing with different scenarios. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details and acceptance criteria."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Endpoints for Schedule Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple endpoints for schedule management with proper validation, authorization checks, and data handling. The implementation involves creating a schedule model, endpoints for generating/saving/retrieving schedules, and handling modifications and sharing. The complexity comes from ensuring proper access control and maintaining data integrity across multiple operations.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement API Endpoints for Schedule Management' task into 5 subtasks, focusing on schedule generation endpoint, schedule saving functionality, schedule retrieval endpoints, schedule modification capabilities, and schedule sharing between room members. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, validation requirements, and acceptance criteria."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Documentation and Error Handling",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"reasoning": "This task involves enhancing the API with proper documentation and error handling, which is important but more straightforward than the algorithmic tasks. The implementation requires adding docstrings, configuring FastAPI documentation, implementing custom error handlers, and standardizing error responses. The code examples show typical patterns for exception handling and OpenAPI customization.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement API Documentation and Error Handling' task into 4 subtasks, focusing on API endpoint documentation, FastAPI documentation configuration, custom error handling implementation, and standardized error response format. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details and acceptance criteria."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Testing and Deployment Configuration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up the entire testing and deployment infrastructure, which requires knowledge of multiple technologies (pytest, MongoDB, Docker, CI/CD). The implementation includes creating test fixtures, containerization, and deployment documentation. The complexity comes from ensuring all components work together correctly in different environments.",
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Testing and Deployment Configuration' task into 5 subtasks, focusing on pytest setup for unit and integration testing, MongoDB test fixtures, CI/CD configuration, Docker containerization, and deployment documentation. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, configuration requirements, and acceptance criteria."
